This is a modified copy of Dmitri Priimak's iptables type, downloaded from
http://www.stanford.edu/~priimak/soft/puppet/iptables/index.html

It's work in progress. Currently ressources are sorted by alphabetical order,
compared with the output of iptables-save, and iptables is then executed if
something differs.

Usage:

iptables { "my iptable rule":
  proto       => "tcp",
  dport       => "80",
  source      => "192.168.1.10",
  destination => "192.168.1.11",
  jump        => "ACCEPT",
}

See modules/iptables/plugins/puppet/type/iptables.rb for the complete list of
parameters.
